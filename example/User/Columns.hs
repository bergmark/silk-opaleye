-- | We use a newtype to reperesent a foreign key
newtype Id = Id { unId :: UUID }
  deriving (Show, Typeable)

-- | This generates the following instances for our type:
--
-- To convert from a postgresql type to Id:
-- > instance FromField Id
--
-- To convert from Id to an opaleye value:
-- > instance ShowConstant Id where
-- >   type PGRep Id = PGRep UUID
--
-- To convert from our type in an opaleye context to the haskell value:
-- > instance PGRep Id ~ a => QueryRunnerColumnDefault Id Id
--
-- Converting to an Id from an opaleye value (for Id this is the identity).
-- > instance Conv Id
--
-- We can look at values on several levels
--
-- 1. As a normal haskell value, represented by UUID. The
-- representation only differs by a newtype (e.g. on the type level)
-- so we can convert between them.
--
-- 2. As an opaleye value (inside queries), here 'Id' has a
-- representation PGRep Id = PGRep UUID = PGUuid. Each level has a
-- different type so that different keys can't be mixed, if we really
-- want to mix them up we can use 'unsafeCoerceColumn' (or safer
-- variants that we provide)
--
-- 3. As a database value, using postgresql's uuid type.
mkId ''Id

-- If we don't have a simple newtype we need a bit more boiler plate:
-- Converting between our types and some other type opaleye already
-- supports.
--
-- Here we have an enum so we can easily convert that to and from a
-- String (or other textual types). It could also be possible to use
-- an enum in postgres for this, but at the current time I don't think
-- opaleye supports it.
--
-- This gives a partial conversion when we go from the database to our
-- type so you should take care that this may need to be migrated if
-- changed.

-- | The 'makeId' call is a more specific version of
